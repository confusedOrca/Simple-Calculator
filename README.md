# Simple-Calculator
## This was an OOP project in java, for CSE215 course taken in 2020.

(This course comes before DSA course. Hence a brute force solution was used instead of using a Stack to find value of mathematical expressions)

(The demos are Youtube videos. Click on them to redirect to the demo on YT)

It performs equation linearly from left to right.
Brackets are added automatically so that our expressions are valid.
Each calculation is stored in a bin as history and can be loaded back for future use.

Multiple calculations can be loaded and reused 
(has memory function found in old calculator such as MR, MS, MC, M+, M-, etc. but is redundant as we can simply load old results from history)

It also does not allow some invalid expressions such as:
expressions starting with +,/,x (allows '-' at start. double '-' at start is treated as +)
prevents more than one decimal point for a number

We can view results as fraction upto a limited number of decimal places

We can also inverse the sign of the last entry

It can also add, subtract, divide and multiply complex numbers

It can solve quadratic equations (and even provide solution as complex numbers if there are no real roots)

It can also solve a system of equations

We can delete a single history data or clear all history at once

It can do some metric conversion
